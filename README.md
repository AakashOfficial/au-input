# Angular Icon Inputs 

This module contains a couple of Angular Input box components that allow to add a SVG icon inside an HTML input.

Any icon available on either the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) or the [Google Material Design](https://material.io/icons/) Icon libraries can be used.

Here is what the icons look like on screen:

# Features

The components have minimum styling and are themable, the styles are isolated and won't interfere in the page where they are deployed. 

The HTML input is not hidden inside the component, so it supports all standard HTML input attributes, including custom attributes (data-), all the accessiblity properties, etc.
