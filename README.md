# Angular Icon Inputs 

This module contains a couple of Angular Input box components that allow to add a SVG icon inside an HTML input.

Any icons available on either the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) or the [Google Material Design](https://material.io/icons/) can be used.

The components have minimum styling and are themable, the styles are isolated and won't interfere in the page where they are deployed. 

Here is what the icons look like on screen:
