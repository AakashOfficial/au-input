# Angular SVG Inputs - Font Awesome and Material Design Icons

This module contains a couple of Angular Input box components that allow to add a SVG icon inside the input. All icons available on either the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) or the [Google Material Design](https://material.io/icons/) icon libraries can be used.

The components have minimum styling and are themable, the styles are isolated and won't interfere in the page where they are deployed. 

Here is what the icons look like on screen:
