# Angular Icon Inputs 

This module contains a couple of Angular Input box components that allow to add an icon inside a text input, which helps to improve user experience and better identify common input fields like for example email, etc.

Any icon available on either the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) or the [Google Material Design](https://material.io/icons/) Icon libraries can be used.

Here is what the icons look like on screen:

# Features

The components have minimum styling and are themable, the styles are isolated and won't interfere in the page where they are deployed. The components are compatible with AOT.

The HTML input is not hidden inside the component, so it supports all standard HTML input attributes, including custom attributes (data-), all the accessiblity properties, etc.


# Installation

This is how to install the components:

    npm install au-input

or 

    yarn add au-input

And on your application module:
